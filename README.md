# Building-a-Decision-Tree-Classifier-Mushroom-Data-Classification

﻿﻿﻿1. Packages
numpy: Fundamental bundle for working with matrices in Python.
Matplotlib: Famous library for plotting graphs in Python.
2. Problem Statement
You reason to categorise mushrooms as match for human intake or poisonous based totally on their bodily attributes.
The task includes implementing a selection tree from scratch.
Three. Dataset
Features:
Cap Color (Brown or Red)
Stalk Shape (Tapering or Enlarging)
Solitary (Yes or No)
Label:
Edible (1 indicating certain or 0 indicating poisonous)
4. Decision Tree Refresher
Start with all examples at the foundation node.
Calculate information advantage for splitting on all feasible functions and pick out the simplest with the very fine facts benefit.
Split dataset in keeping with the chosen characteristic into left and right branches.
Repeat splitting manner till preventing criteria are met (e.G., maximum intensity).
4.1 Calculate Entropy
Compute entropy (diploma of impurity)
4.2 Split Dataset
Split the statistics at a node into left and proper branches based totally on a given characteristic.
Use the function to differentiate a number of the branches.
Four.Three Calculate Information Gain
Compute the facts benefit from splitting on a given characteristic.
4.4 Get Best Split
Find the amazing function to interrupt up on through computing the statistics gain from every function.
Return the function that offers the maximum information gain.
5. Building the Tree
Use the functions carried out above to generate a preference tree.
Successively pick out the great feature to break up on till the stopping standards are met (e.G., most intensity is reached).
Note
The dataset is for illustrative purposes satisfactory and no longer supposed as a guide for identifying secure to devour mushrooms.
